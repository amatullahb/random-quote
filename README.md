## Project 1 - Random Quote Generator

### Project Requirements

Build a random quote generator, which displays quotations on a page and can be controlled by the user.

1. Locate and select quotes.
2. Build an array of quote objects.
3. Write functions for selecting random quotes and printing them.

#### Extra Credit

* Add more properties to the quote object. For example, a tags property could include a list of "tags" like -- "humor", "business", "politics" -- to categorize each quote.
* Randomly change the background color of the page, when the quote changes
* Don't display a random quote more than once until ALL quotes from the array have been displayed.
* Refresh the quote after a set amount of time. For example, every 30 seconds, make a new quote appear.
